# Viktor - My Server Lol

Viktor is a talking chatbot combined with the power of LLM and the newest F5-TTS model. I plan to give Viktor some toolkit access and more flexibility in what he can do to make it a self-observant server system.

## Technologies Used
- **Ollama** for execution
- **DeepSeek R1 1.5B model** for faster responses (For now)

## Development Status
The UI is just for trying out purposes for now, but I will release the full server system soon enough once I am less busy.
